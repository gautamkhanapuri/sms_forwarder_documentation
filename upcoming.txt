Improvements and updates to the mobile application:
1. Create a toggle to enable/disable case sensitive matching.
2. Add a help button on all mobile app pages which links to help page.
3. Upon opening the app first, ask to set either biometric or pin. Right now it is predefined to 1234.
4. A way to forward all messages. And keep all other active. Maybe there can be a smart way to filter out sending out repeated messages
5. Allow option to forward to both email and telegram.
6. Improve forwarded message format to telegram. Right now it simply copy-pastes the content. Sender, date time should nicely formatted.
7. Improve user experience. When new user joins. Give instructions, get them to create pin, setup biometric and redirect to browser -  the website so that they can login using sso, generate token and and come back to the website to add token.
8. "From" option is not very intuitive. Create a rule on what is matched first, content or from.


Improvements to documentation:
1. Write the documentation for new features.
2. Create a how to use video and embed it on the webiste
